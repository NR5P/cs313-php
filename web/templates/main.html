    Hi, my name is Nathan Rigg. I've been interested in electronics much of my life. I started learning software development
    about 4 years ago. I also enjoy plants and homesteading, I'm in the process of combining all 3 of my enjoyments into my
    life together. I'm building a home automation system controlled by a raspberry pi for controlling irrigation and recording
    water usage.
